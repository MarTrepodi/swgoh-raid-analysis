# üõ∏ SWGoH Raid Analysis - Help Guide

<Card title="Getting Started" icon="üöÄ">
  Welcome to the SWGoH Raid Analysis tool! This application automatically analyzes your guild's raid performance based on CSV files from Wookiebot.

  ## Quick Setup

  ### 1. Fork This Repository
  1. Go to [https://github.com/bataillon-swgoh/swgoh-raid-analysis](https://github.com/bataillon-swgoh/swgoh-raid-analysis)
  2. Click the **"Fork"** button in the top right to create your own copy of the repository
  3. Give your repository a name (e.g., `my-guild-raids`, `guild-name-analysis`)
  4. Make sure it's set to **Public** (required for GitHub Pages)
  5. Click **"Create fork"**

  #### Keeping Your Fork Up to Date
  To get new features and bugfixes, you should regularly update your fork from the original repository:

  1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub
  2. Click the **"Sync fork"** button (usually above the file list or in the "Contribute" dropdown)
  3. In the dialog, click the **"Update branch"** button to sync your fork with the latest changes from the original repository.

  **Warning:** Never click **"Discard Commits"** when syncing your fork! This will permanently delete your own raid results and data. Always use the **"Update branch"** option to keep your changes.

  5. The workflow will be automatically detected

  ### 3. Add Your Guild Data
  1. In Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, use the Wookiebot command:
     ```
     /raid guild
     ```
     Add your desired parameters (effort level, etc.)
  2. Download the generated CSV file from Wookiebot

  2. Click **"Add file"** ‚Üí **"Upload files"**
  3. Upload your downloaded CSV file(s)
  4. Commit the changes with a message like "Add raid data"
